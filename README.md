# Weather Application

## Description
The goal was to create a simple weather forecasting application by consuming data from external [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com).
This project was done as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) learning path.

**Live demo is accessible [here](https://durajrafal.github.io/WeatherApp/).**

## My improvements
* Instead of using javascript I decided to use typescript.
